# whatsbot
A run in seconds node app to send Whatsapp messages from your personal account via API call

- Ever stuck in a hackathon like environment where you need solution to send whatsapp messages to anyone via API call
- Need a temporary whatsapp API integration but can't pass through the hassled Whatsapp's Business policy verifications
- Play with the code and integrate your chatbot with whatsapp



## Limitations

- Unoffocial implemenation, may stop working anytime (Once whatsapp people tweak with their web version )
- Currently only supports sending text messages
- Unstable behaviour (I built this over 2 cup of coffees)
